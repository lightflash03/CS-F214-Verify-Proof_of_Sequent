@section section1 Documentation of the Algorithm used:

We have made multiple functions to implement the tasks given in the Problem Statement.

There is one function each in the code to perform the required algorithm corresponding to a given operator. 

The code works for inputs which pertain to the semantics/ input rules mentioned in the problem statement, for example, inclusion of brackets specifying the premises, etc...

For example:
We have made a function called AndEli1, which corresponds to doing And Elimination - 1 to the premises in the input sequent, or, for instance, the ImpEli function, which checks for the validity of the Implication Elimination function in the input sequent.

The responsibility of our code is to check whether the proof of given sequent mentioned is valid or not.

We have approached it in a way that we check for the type of rule the user is going to use, define the rule for our code, and check whether the user has used the rule correctly or not.

The definitions of the rules being already given to us in the Assignment task, we could just verify for the given few number of rules to us.

@section section2 Extension of the Algorithm for further rules:

Similarly, we can create more functions that act on the user-input to extend this code to a larger palette of operations.

So, we may include verification for theorems like Double-Negation Elimination, etc...

Verification for all these rules can be approached in a similar way, which is what we believe, makes our code very extendable.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to work on this very interesting project.
